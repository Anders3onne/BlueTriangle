To get an isoscele triangle        has 2 equal sides                                                         2;2;3              [2,2,3] is Isoscele Triangle
To get an Equilateral Triangle     has all equal sides                                                       4;4;4              [4,4,4] is Equilateral Triangle  
To get an Scalene Triangle         the sum of 2 sides are greater than the third side                        3;2;4              [3,2,4] is Scalene Triangle
Not a triangle                     the sum of 2 sides is equal to or less than the third side                12;5;7             [12,5,7] is not a triangle
Undefined                          0 as one side and other sides have other numbers                          0;5;7              [0;5;7]  Undefined
